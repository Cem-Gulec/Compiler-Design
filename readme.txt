# Tokens are generated one by one calling "get_next_token" method 
of "LexicalAnalyzer" class and then saving to specified output 
file for testing purposes #

source code path -> .\sample_source_code.txt
output path for generated tokens -> .\sample_output_tokens.txt

You can run the compiler with the following example command,
to be able to test lexical analyzer module: 

command -> compiler.py .\sample_source_codes\test_source_code.flex
